Here, the data encompasses many distinct attributes. We might find interesting correlations here...

### 2. Correlation between some aspects and twitter growth.
 - Salary

The graphs above illustrates the correltaion between salary and varioous twitter attributes. From the first graph, we obtain that the pearson coefficient = **0.238**, which is close to 0; therefore, there is no strong indication between salary and favourite count. The same goes for the second graph. We obtain that the pearson coefficient = **0.241**, which indicate little correlation between salary and retweet count.
 
 - Wins

Now we try to compare other aspects, namely the number of wins and its corresponding effect towards twitter growth. The pearson coefficient for first and second paragraph are **0.194** and **0.12** respectively, which is considerably low, even lower than salary! Hence, we can deduce that wins do not influence the number of favourite and retweet count inasmuch as salary.

All in all, although both did not present apparent contributions to the growth of NBA player twitter, it is considerably better to select player in which has higher salary than higher nnumber of wins to boost the popularity of twitter.
